To run the programme, it is necessary to add the "v2p6" folder, "tdmsSubfunctions" folder wihin "v2p6" folder, and current folder into your matlab path.

The "find_differnence.m" file will take long time to run but it will show the error between real value and input tdms value, if there are any. 

☆☆ Sometimes there are differences but something there is no difference. Presumably such phenomenon is related to the RAM of the PC on which the programme runs. 
However, we decided not to risk and chose to use csv file as a more stable method.

By the way, the "a.tdms" is identical to the same name file in the "Captured data" folder.
